This project makes small prototypes of web formulars or webpages.

It uses Rakudo to compile a specification into a html-page which can be rendered in a browser.

The specification in inputspec.txt should be a complete example of the functionality of the project.

The inputspec.txt is read line by line, and inserted into the output page.
